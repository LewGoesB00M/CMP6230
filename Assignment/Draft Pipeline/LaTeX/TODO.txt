FINAL TODOs BEFORE SUBMISSION:
    Section 1 still may benefit from being rewritten.
    It's loads of pages but maybe one page of actual writing.

    Especially ensure Candidate 2 is detailed at least given 
    that it's the selected dataset.

    Diagrams, simple & straightforward.

    Will it be ingested ELT? It might be better 
    to use ETL given that it's a CSV. Idk
    The examples use ETL.

    Specify inputs and outputs of ML pipeline stages.
