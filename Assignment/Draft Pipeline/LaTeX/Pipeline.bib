	abstract = {Objectives The Indian Liver Patient Dataset ({ILPD}) is used extensively to create algorithms that predict liver disease. Given the existing research describing demographic inequities in liver disease diagnosis and management, these algorithms require scrutiny for potential biases. We address this overlooked issue by investigating {ILPD} models for sex bias.Methods Following our literature review of {ILPD} papers, the models reported in existing studies are recreated and then interrogated for bias. We define four experiments, training on sex-unbalanced/balanced data, with and without feature selection. We build random forests ({RFs}), support vector machines ({SVMs}), Gaussian Naïve Bayes and logistic regression ({LR}) classifiers, running experiments 100 times, reporting average results with {SD}.Results We reproduce published models achieving accuracies of {\textgreater}70\% ({LR} 71.31\% (2.37 {SD}) – {SVM} 79.40\% (2.50 {SD})) and demonstrate a previously unobserved performance disparity. Across all classifiers females suffer from a higher false negative rate ({FNR}). Presently, {RF} and {LR} classifiers are reported as the most effective models, yet in our experiments they demonstrate the greatest {FNR} disparity ({RF}; −21.02\%; {LR}; −24.07\%).Discussion We demonstrate a sex disparity that exists in published {ILPD} classifiers. In practice, the higher {FNR} for females would manifest as increased rates of missed diagnosis for female patients and a consequent lack of appropriate care. Our study demonstrates that evaluating biases in the initial stages of machine learning can provide insights into inequalities in current clinical practice, reveal pathophysiological differences between the male and females, and can mitigate the digitisation of inequalities into algorithmic systems.Conclusion Our findings are important to medical data scientists, clinicians and policy-makers involved in the implementation medical artificial intelligence systems. An awareness of the potential biases of these systems is essential in preventing the digital exacerbation of healthcare inequalities.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease ({CVD}) continues to be the foremost worldwide contributor to mortality, leading to millions of deaths each year. Machine learning methods provide a powerful means of prediction. By employing patient data encompassing factors such as age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, machine learning ({ML}) models empower precise predictions, facilitating early detection and focused intervention. This study’s main goal is to investigate how machine learning algorithms can be used to predict heart illness, utilizing a data set with 1000 instances and 12 features from an Indian multi-specialty hospital obtained from Mendeley. The research primarily utilizes four boosting-based machine learning approaches, including Light Gradient Boosting ({LightGBM}), Extreme Gradient Boosting ({XGBoost}), Adaptive Boosting ({AdaBoost}), and Categorical Boosting ({CatBoost}), to predict cardiac disease. To enhance the performance of each algorithm and identify the best optimization strategy, we explored three methods: grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Precision, accuracy, F1 score, and recall were used to evaluate the models. Significantly, the use of {CatBoost} combined with random search hyperparameter optimization yielded superior results compared to the alternative models, attaining a noteworthy accuracy rate of 99.00\%. Our findings suggest that the suggested approach might be a reliable way of predicting cardiac disease in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Heart Disease is still an epidemic global health concern, so trustworthy prediction models are vital for risk assessment and early detection. In this research, we propose a comprehensive predictive framework leveraging ensemble learning techniques alongside traditional Machine Learning ({ML}) models to increase forecasting of cardio disease accuracy. Utilizing a dataset sourced from Cardiovascular\_Disease\_Dataset, demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors were incorporated as features. The performance of Naive Bayes ({NB}), {AdaBoost}, Support Vector Classifier ({SVC}) and Logistic Regression ({LR}) both individually and within ensemble frameworks, was evaluated using accuracy of 98\% and {AUROC} (Area-Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 99.845\% as a primary metric. Our results demonstrate how effective ensemble learning strategies are in obtaining higher accuracy, precision-recall and along with {AUROC} curve for heart disease prediction compared to individual classifiers. This study underscores the importance of ensemble methods in improving predictive performance and contributing to enhanced clinical decision-making in cardiovascular health management.},
