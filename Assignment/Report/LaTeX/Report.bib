	abstract = {The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‘research’ means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

	abstract = {With the development of Internet technology, we have ushered in the “big data era”. The arrival of big data has made data calculation, acquisition, and statistics more convenient, and has had a significant impact on people’s lives, social management, and national governance. However, because the information unearthed by big data analysis technology may exceed people’s imagination, its privacy issues have also attracted much attention. This paper first briefly introduces the definition and current status of big data and its privacy issues, describes the privacy protection link model, and then starts from the privacy protection technology of big data, introduces the K-anonymization traditional big data privacy protection technology, advantages and disadvantages, Specific algorithms, etc.},
