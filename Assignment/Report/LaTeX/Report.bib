	abstract = {The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what ‚Äòresearch‚Äô means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric.},

The arrival of big data has made data calculation, acquisition, and statistics more convenient, and has had a significant impact on people‚Äôs lives, social management, and national governance. However, because the information unearthed by big data analysis technology may exceed people‚Äôs imagination, its privacy issues have also attracted much attention. This paper first briefly introduces the definition and current status of big data and its privacy issues, describes the privacy protection link model, and then starts from the privacy protection technology of big data, introduces the K-anonymization traditional big data privacy protection technology, advantages and disadvantages, Specific algorithms, etc.},

Monitoring models in production is a critical aspect of ensuring their continued performance and reliability. We present Amazon {SageMaker} Model Monitor, a fully managed service that continuously monitors the quality of machine learning models hosted on Amazon {SageMaker}. Our system automatically detects data, concept, bias, and feature attribution drift in models in real-time and provides alerts so that model owners can take corrective actions and thereby maintain high quality models. We describe the key requirements obtained from customers, system design and architecture, and methodology for detecting different types of drift. Further, we provide quantitative evaluations followed by use cases, insights, and lessons learned from more than two years of production deployment.},

Monitoring models already deployed in big data environments brings the additional challenges of adding monitoring in parallel to the existing modelling workflow and controlling resource requirements. In this paper, we describe (1) a framework for monitoring machine learning models; and, (2) its implementation for a big data supply chain application. We use our implementation to study drift in model features, predictions, and performance on three real data sets. We compare hypothesis test and information theoretic approaches to drift detection in features and predictions using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and Bhattacharyya coefficient. Results showed that model performance was stable over the evaluation period. Features and predictions showed statistically significant drifts; however, these drifts were not linked to changes in model performance during the time of our study.},
