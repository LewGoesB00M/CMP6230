docker exec -it mcs1 bash

	Used from the host terminal, opens a bash terminal in the mcs1 container and executes further commands from that new terminal on the container rather
	than the host. This requires the mcs1 container to be running. If it isn't, then "docker start mcs1" should be used. "docker ps" can show running containers.

mysql --user=root --password=password

	From the bash terminal inside the mcs1 container, this command will log in to MySQL using the default root account. Alternatively, I could log in to the 
	account I created by setting user to lewis and password to dockerVBox.

SHOW databases;

	From the MySQL command line inside the container, this command will show all stored databases (9 at this point).

USE Iris;
	
	From the MySQL command line inside the container, this command will set all further SQL commands to be executed on the Iris database.

SHOW tables;

	When a database has been selected from the MySQL command line inside the container, this command will show all the tables within the database.

SELECT * FROM Iris;

	When the Iris database has been selected from the MySQL command line inside the container, this command will output the entire contents of the Iris table to
	the terminal. The Iris database has a table called Iris, which is why this works.

exit
	
	Exits the Iris database.

exit

	Exits MySQL.
